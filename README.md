# SIP-Code-Sample

Python code for review by Sam Hooper and Davyd Halyn Betchkal for the 2024 SIP Technical Computing and Acoustics Internship. 

I wrote this code for a recent assignment in my Environmental Data Science course. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate ability to wrangle adn clean data, make plots, and transform variables.
