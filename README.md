# SIP Internship Code Sample

Python and R code samples for review by Sam Hooper and Davyd Halyn Betchkal for the 2024 SIP Technical Computing and Acoustics Internship. 

The Python sample was written for a recent assignment for my Environmental Data Science course. The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate ability to wrangle and clean data, make plots, and transform variables. 

The R sample was written for a project in a past introductory statistics course.
